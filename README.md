# Iterated Tabu Search for the Multi-Compartment Truck and Trailer Routing Problem (ITS_MC-TTRP)

This is version 0.1 of a novel heuristic based in Iterated Tabu Search method, to solve MC-TTRP optimization problems. The ITS_MC-TTRP code has been implemented using R 4.0.2, and it has been tested in Linux clusters running CentOS 6.7 and in Windows 10 laptops.

For the reproducibility of the results presented in the main paper, we recommend using example scripts located in the folder "reproducibility". Moreover, the different routing problems used (MC-TTRPs and TTRPs) are located in the folder "instances".
